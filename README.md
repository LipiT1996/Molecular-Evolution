# Molecular-Evolution
Using Matlab to demonstrate molecular evolution bt Genetic Drift. 

In this assignment I will run a simple simulation of genetic drift and report the result
of some simple experiments. 

Gdrift(N,p,g,col)

where N is the population size, p is the initial probability for selecting Allele A, g is the
number of generations and col is the color of the graph, 
Running this simulation will produce a plot of the Allele frequency vs. the total number
of generations.

In this homework you are supposed to report 3 plots resulting from 3
different experiments. In one experiment you can change the size of the population
while the other parameters remain constant. In another experiment you are sup-
posed to change the probability p while other parameters are fixed and finally in a
third experiment you are to report plots when the number of generations increase
for a given set of fixed parameters. The actual value of the parameters are your
choice just be sure to report the actual values with their respective plots
